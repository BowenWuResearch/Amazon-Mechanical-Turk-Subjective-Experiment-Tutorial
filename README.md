# Amazon-Mechanical-Turk-Subjective-Experiment-Tutorial
How a subjective experiment should be conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Abbriviations
AWS -- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)\
AMT -- [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com)\
HTML -- [HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) for website coding\
AS3 -- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)\
AMT-Sandbox -- [AMT Sandbox](https://requester.mturk.com/developer/sandbox)

## Requirements
1. An AWS account.
2. Basic knowledge of HTML for website coding.
3. (Optional) An AS3 to store whatever media you want to use in the experiment, e.g., images, audio, videos, etc. The procedure for creating an S3 bucket and how to upload data to it is detailed below.

## Overview
You will use your AWS account to create an AMT project, where you will edit a website in HTML to fit your experimental purposes, such as adding questions or media. To make sure everything is intended, or for a preliminary study, you will test your experiment using AMT-Sandbox. Then you can publish your experiment through AMT and wait for the responses.
