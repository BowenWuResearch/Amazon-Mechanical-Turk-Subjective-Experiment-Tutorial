## Overview
This tutorial begins with nothing to the end of publishing of a experiment in AMT.
We will start from the creation of an AWS account, using which an AMT project will be created.
In the project, a webpage is used as the interface to the participant.
One can edit the webpage using HTML for specific experimental purposes, such as adding questions or media.
We assume that the media will be stored in AS3, which will also be mentioned in detail.
To test whether everything is correct, or to conduct a preliminary study, AMT-Sandbox is the best tool. 
Finally, the experiment can be published through AMT, and we can wait for the responses.

## Creation of AWS Account
You probably will not need to use your own account. 
The lab will provide an official account for you because they will pay the fee. 
However, it is better for testing the experiment using AMT-Sandbox, in which case you still need to use your own account. 
The following procedure shows how you can create an AWS account using an existing email address.

1. Navigate to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and click on `Sign In to the Console`.

3. Input email address and account name whatever you want, and follow their instructions to complete the sign up, which requires password, contact information, a credit/debit card, and a phone number. Finally, choose the `Basic support - Free` to complete.
