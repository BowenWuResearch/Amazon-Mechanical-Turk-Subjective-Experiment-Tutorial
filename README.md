## Overview
This tutorial begins with nothing but an email address, to the publishing of a experiment in AMT.
We will start from the creation of an AWS account, using which an AMT project will be created.
In the project, a website is used as the interface to the participant, which one can edit using HTML to fit specific experimental purposes, such as adding questions or media stored using AS3.
We will also cover the usage of AS3.
To make sure everything is intended, or for a preliminary study, one can test the experiment using AMT-Sandbox. 
Finally, the experiment can be published through AMT, and we can wait for the responses.

## Creation of AWS Account
You probably will not need to use your own account. The lab will provide an official account for you because they will pay the fee. However, there maybe a need for testing the experiment using AMT-Sandbox, in which case you may still need to use your own account. The following procedure shows how you can create an AWS account using an existing email address.

1. Navigate to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and click on `Sign In to the Console`.
